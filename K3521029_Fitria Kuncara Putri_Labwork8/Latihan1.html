	<h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

	<p>
		The <span class="demo">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span class="demo">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an <span class="demo">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span class="demo">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="demo">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="demo">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span class="demo">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="demo">Building Engineering Education</span>, and <span class="demo">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="demo">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
